        <h3>Eliminate your webmaster CMS Headaches</h3>
        <p><em>“Webster123 can store multiple websites in one file”</em></p>
        <p>Updating WordPress for simple changes like a phone number can be cumbersome and prone to frequent downtime. If you manage multiple calling card sites, the maintenance can become overwhelming. Webster123 simplifies this process by storing multiple websites in a single spreadsheet-compatible file. This approach eliminates the need for complex CMS systems, reduces server load, and makes site management more straightforward and reliable.</p>

<p>Double click a cell and the edit window appears. Webster is intuitive. Each line is a web page. It starts with a site id that you choose, where you will put the web page on your drive and a url, commonly called the ""slug"". From there it's title, content, menu header and footer just like Wordpress. Here you do it in html. You provide a url for your stylesheet on the net, or on your hard drive like file:///c:/stylesheets/my-stylesheet.css. </p>

<img src=""https://webster123.com/screenshot2.jpg"" style=""width: 100%; height: auto;""  alt=""Screenshot2"">
<p>Here we have scrolled to the left to capture the other elements of our web pages. You provide a url for your scripts (if you have some) on the net, or on your hard drive like file:///c:/scripts/my-script.js. <br>
You also provide the file extension, html or php. You need php on your local computer for the file extension to be php. If not, you can still build pages but they can only be viewed on the internet. Other entries at this end help Webster to form urls for the internet related to your website. There are hooks for the html and head tags of your site. This is where you put php declarations and scripts such as Google Analytics.</p>

<p>In this screenshot we have selected a row, right clicked for a popup menu and have selected ""Publish Selected Rows"". With a click and shift click we can select hundreds of rows and publish hundreds of pages to our disk and simply ftp them to the site.</p>

<p>This tool allows you to generate static HTML pages, save them to your local drive so that you can ftp them to your site.<br>
<h3>Simple Operation</h3></p>

<p>The toolbar provides quick access to essential functions such as loading a CSV file, saving a CSV file, publishing rows to disk, and viewing HTML pages.</p>

<h3> Double Click to Edit</h3>
<p>To edit the content of a cell, double-click on the cell you want to edit. A text editor will appear where you can make changes. Click 'Save' to save the changes or 'Cancel' to discard them.</p>

<h3>Set It up and Publish</h3>
<p>To publish your web pages, click on the row number to highlight the row. You can select multiple pages to publish by using the shift click to select multiple rows. Once you have selected a row, then right click on the row to get a menu. Select ""Publish Selected Rows""</p>

<h3>View the Page You Made""</h3>

<p>To view your web pages, click on the row number to highlight the row. You can select multiple pages to publish by using the shift click to select multiple rows. Once you have selected a row, then right click on the row to get a menu. Select ""View Html""</p>

<h2> Let's Go</h2>
<p>The program loads with a web page in the first row. It is a simple page that shows the only requirements to use this tool to teach yourself html or php. It excels as a ""Try this Code Tool"". With php, you have to have php installed on your computer but with html you do not.</p>
<h2>Basic Requirements To Create a Page</h2>
<blockquote><h3>Must Haves</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ourUrl</li>
<li>folderPath (where are we putting it?)</li>
<li>fileExtension (html or php)</li>
</ul>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><h3>Now What do you Want To Do?</h3>
<p>Like Wordpress and many other content creation methods, We basically provide user space for a Header, a Title, Our Content and a Footer.
<ul>
<li>ourHeader</li>
<li>ourTitle</li>
<li>ourContent (Our html for the content)</li>
<li>Extra1 and Extra2 (Extra Content)</li>
<li>ourFooter</li>
</ul>
Using Webster123 to learn makes html fun.

            <h3>What is SEO</h3>
            <p>Search engine optimization or SEO is a process by which we help your website rise in searches on the Internet for your product or service.
            If your website is well-designed then you have a presentation for your customer. Often after a website is designed, the next question that arises is, “why can’t I find my website on the Internet when I search for my product or service. It is often easy to find your website when you ask for it directly but your customers, often, art asking for you but for your product or service.</p>
        </div>
        <div class=""column"">
            <h3>What Affects SEO</h3>
            <p>Search engine optimization involves goal three steps:
            1. The words that you say on your website.
            2. The strength of your website.
            3. The links to your website. Links to your website are like references for a job for which you are applying. Who are you references and who are they. It’s a matter of how many websites link to you and who they are. If they are powerful, then their link to you will help you more than if they are less than powerful.
            4. The relevance of links to you. Were the articles full of content and important and on topic.</p>

            <h3>How We Can Help</h3>
            <p>We are part of a network of e-zines and websites that have been on the Internet since 1998. We can link our websites to you and we can help you say the right words in the right sequence to hit what we call “keywords”, those words that your customer is asking for. Often this work is extensive requiring lots of time and effort. We become your biggest fan, the blogger who is excited about you, the writer who writes about you and links to you. Our goal is to make your phone ring.</p>

            <h4>It’s a partnership this making a phone ring.</h4>
            <p>The business of SEO is a business of helping people generate leads through phone calls or contacts that come from search engines and local maps and searches for local keywords. A local keyword example is “used car”. This search will produce a map. If that is your product you want to be on that map.</p>

            <h4>How does this start?</h4>
            <p>We evaluate your current position and advise you of what you can do without us. Sometimes it is a process of linking and waiting for Google or other search engines to recognize articles or links that we have introduced for you. We can install certain plug-ins that can help and, if needed, we can rearrange the words on your site such that you’re ready on your end.</p></div>
